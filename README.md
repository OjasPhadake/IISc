Codes written at PRN Lab during Summer Internship for understanding granular heap dynamics

As the data files are of several GB worth data, I am adding the codes separately as well as in their published formats for visualization. Data of various simulations understanding physical properties such as force chains, force lines, contour plots, velocity fields have been plotted. 

## Tools used:
1. LAMMPS
2. LIGGGHTS (data-generation)
3. MATLAB (post-processing)
